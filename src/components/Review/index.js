       <h6>I drive an hour here from south Houston because I'm always taken care of. My hair is really straight and thin which makes it easy to see any deficiency, but here it doesn't matter who I get as my barber my cut is always in point here. Worth every mile and penny! </h6><p> J Q ,  07/2022</p>

       <h6>Customer service should always come first and at Vital Cutz it did! I came in with my 2 year old grandson to get his hair cut before his birthday party. Usually, he is very good when he gets a haircut. For some reason he decided he did not want one yesterday and he began to throw a fit while in the chair. The young man who was helping us was very patient and gentle as he cut my grandson's hair. Never once expressed any anger at the wiggling 2 year old. A second barber came over to help and they were able to comfort him and get him to relac while his hair was being cut. The end results, even with all of his wiggling, was a really good haircut. Thank you both for being to kind to my fussy 2 year old grandson.</h6><p>Cheryl Berry Williams , 03/14/22</p>

       <h6>Wow all the barbers are good! That's a hard find. It's perfect when you have two or more kids and they can sit down all at the same time and not wait for the best barber. Thank God I found this place! </h6> <p>La'Tanya McDowell , 09/2021</p>
